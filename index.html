<b>Appearance</b><br>
<i>Height:</i> 5'8"<br>
<i>Weight:</i> 125 lbs.<br>
The embodiment of Humility is a very slender and dainty individual. Her height is fairly average for human females, and her physique is very much akin to what most would imagine to be fitting for a "princess" or even a "damsel in distress." She possesses the same signature hourglass figure shared by a majority of females, and even though her attributes aren't necessarily voluptuous in comparison to other women, the bumps and bulges are shapely against her own build, giving the illusion of being well endowed. Joy's flesh is darkened to an olive tan thanks to her many days of work under a bright sun, but has no blemish or mark save for very faint freckles splashed over her nose and cheeks. Her facial features are very young, with full pink lips, a cute ever so slightly upturned button nose, and big beautiful eyes that glisten a bright amber and crinkle around their edges when she smiles in a fashion that can be considered motherly. Slender golden brows, and a head of very long silky locks of golden hair that seems to give off a barely noticeable glow as though light itself has been caught in the strands, do well to accentuate the regal lines of her angular jaw and high cheekbones.
<br><br>
<b>Attire</b><br>
As dictated by the culture of her Kingdom, Joy is required to wear minimalistic clothing, the only exception to this rule is during special events or ritualistic ceremonies. When she is dressed casually, Humility can typically be found in long flowing white gowns remniscent of Greek and Roman style togas, with either bare feet or simplistic leather sandals. If she wishes to decorate herself in any way, she must do so with whatever the natural environment provides for her, often leading to her wearing a headband of flowers woven by her own hands.
<br>
Should a special event arise her attire is much more reflective of what would be expected for a priestess: long white hooded robes, simplistic blessed charms around her ankles, wrists, and neck, as well as very small amounts of gold glitter dusted over her eyelids. The robes may vary depending on the event in which she is required to wear them, and will be described in detail during the role-play should the need arise.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Joy very strongly reflects the Virtue she embodies. She is humble above all else, thankful in all things and always passing focus, gratitude, or even credit away from herself and onto candidates she feels more worthy. Hesitation is shown when faced with controversial decisions, preferring to ask the advice of those around her rather than depend entirely on her own judgement. Often perceived as shy, she is mostly just quiet, strongly believing that everyone else deserves a say before she should open her own mouth. Unfortunately this also opens the naive Virtue to the strong possibility of being manipulated and taken advantage of; she is too easily swayed to a cause, if it can be proved beneficial to humanity in general.

Under re-work, a vast majority of this character is. I'll be keeping a lot of the same base ideas, but changing up things like her place of origin, her abilities, and such. This is quite the task and may be a work in progress for a long time, please bear with me. For now I will leave a good chunk of information the same and start most of the rehaul from her backstory, then progress my way through other things. I apologize in advance if some information contradicts others, that simply means I haven't gotten to reworking that part yet. Thank you.

Her Story Thus Far
</div>

<div id="tab4">
<b>Fighting Style:</b><br>Defensive<br><br>
<i>Light of Holy Sanctuary</i><br>
Joy can gather light from various other sources (assuming there are sources around her to draw from, whether it be sunlight, moonlight, starlight, candlelight, etc) and use it in its raw condensed form to act as a source of illumination in darkness. Should she spend time channeling the light through herself as though she were some kind of holy prayer filter, she can supercharge its purity with praise and give it a solid tangible form that can be shaped as she so chooses, and trades any sense of offensive ability or intent to instead use this purified substance as a healing energy. If enough time, energy, and light is provided then any wound can eventually be healed through these means. While this tactic can be used on the Sins, for them it would be an unintentionally excruciating process given the holy nature of her ability.
<br><br>
<i>Aegis of the Blessed</i><br>
A protector and supporter, but never a means of offensive action, the Virtue of Humility is in technicality a pacifist. Her energy exceeds in its defensive qualities and can manifest in physical forms, specifically as powerful barriers, wards, and shields meant to counter an aggressor rather than do any intentional harm. Being still considered the energy of a holy maiden, these barriers are especially effective when it comes to warding off evil. They can act as buffers against the physical and intangible “attacks” from those with ill intent, whether they be aimed at the mind or the body, effectively allowing her to create “safe spaces” outside of sinful influence.
<br><br>
<i>Divine Intervention</i><br>
Always willing to fade into the background and offer support, in addition to the acts of healing and providing protection, Joy is also very adept in providing support for her allies and peers through the act of prayer. Her strong faith in the abilities of her allies--confirmed by spoken chants and ritualistic songs--can be saturated with the physicality of her holy essence and provide them with temporary but lasting boosts in their base physical abilities. The particular boons she can provide are limited to the style, action, and intent of the person being blessed, and only one can be active on a different individual at a time.
<br>
(Example: Someone actively in the middle of throwing a punch while being prayed for to activate Divine Intervention would receive a buff to their physical strength allowing them to hit twice as fast and hard as they normally would. Things of that nature.)
<br><br>
<i>Divine Projection: Wyvern-Hearted</i><br>
A far more advanced form of her ability to manifest her own energy into physical wards of protection, requiring a lot more power and ultimately a heavy strain on physically and spiritually. Divine Projection allows Joy to embrace her “spirit animal” and use the inherently protective solid form of her energy to create an intricate aura in the shape of that creature around her body; in this case, the creature in question is a Wyvern. Visually it is very draconic in nature, with big wings replacing what most upright creatures would have as arms, and only two legs, attached to a burly body with a long neck and tail. The Wyvern is only a construct and acts like an extension of Joy herself, it doesn’t have a mind or consciousness of its own and operates like a second body to her specifically. When it is active she remains stationary inside of its “chest” area where a heart would be if the creature were real. The energy that makes up its exterior is golden but translucent, allowing anyone to see very easily that it’s nothing more than a construct of energy and that a person controlling it resides inside.
<br>
From the end of its nose to the tip of its tail, the Projection is roughly twenty five feet in length, and even when stretching out its neck it only stands at roughly eleven feet in height. Its wingspan is fairly massive, both wings together measuring fifty feet at the most when stretched as far as they can go, although keeping balance on the ground requires the wings to be folded so they’re not useful for much other than flying or thrusting out in a desperate attempt to protect a comrade. Even as an energy construct this form is very heavy, making it harder to knock over or away, but as a result making it slower (on land) and a huge strain to fly for long periods of time. Whenever this ability is used, deactivation requires a cooldown so Humility can rest and recuperate, otherwise she’d wear herself down straight to death.
<br>
The Wyvern is capable of carrying up to four people (at the most) on its back, although the more people the heavier her load, and flying at impressive speeds through the air assuming she remains at a decent elevation. Its clawed feet can be used for picking things up or tearing through things, but its main benefit (other than transportation) is that it still behaves like a big moving barrier allowing some protection from physical attacks. Joy can also amplify a scream through its mouth like a roar, although this has no effect save for making a lot of noise to either alert others to her presence or call for help.

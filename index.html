<h1>Personal Rules</h1>
I know, anyone who's bothered to enable flash and have a look at this character sheet is probably rolling their eyes about now. Don't worry I'm not fragile enough to just block people who don't follow these rules, they're more like guidelines or shared tidbits of information to help you know what kind of role-player I am before you invest any time into building a story with me. These rules are for the sake of our mutual enjoyment, if they're not abided by then absolute worst case scenario would be that I lose interest in the role-play and let you know I'd rather not post to it anymore. Anyway let's get on with what my terms actually are!
<br><br>
<li><b>1.</b> Group links are welcome! I'm not going to visit much if there's no actual role-play going on and it's just a bunch of nothing but O.O.C. conversation though. Nothing against the group owners or other members that frequent the chat, just an individual with limited time who'd prefer to spend it elsewhere if nothing's happening.</li>
<li><b>2.</b> I always <i>prefer</i> to talk about plot and stuff before jumping right into a role-play, but random starters are still welcome, I'm not that picky.</li>
<li><b>3.</b> I am <i>not</i> interested in romance, cyber, or erotic role-play. Most of my characters are spoken for regardless, but I prefer to leave them spoken for with the characters of the person I'm actually with. A personal preference by all means, but one I'm not going to change. There's plenty of other girls around that would be willing to stroke your e-peen or e-vagine, I'm just not one of them. All other kinds of adult subjects though? Open game.</li>
<li><b>4.</b> My replies will be slow more often than not. If you're going to expect me to drop everything and respond with a post as soon as you send one then I'm sorry but I'm not the partner for you. I have a life that takes priority and other activities I find more fun. I won't just stop responding altogether out of nowhere (unless there's a really good reason for it) but my world doesn't revolve around you, I'm liable to take my sweet time and do as I please, or get other important stuff done, before writing up another post for you. If that's acceptable and you're still willing to role-play with me then awesome! Congrats, you're one of the few people left around here that's not super self entitled, give yourself a pat on the back. ♥</li>
<li><b>5.</b> I'm not against role-players who post in single sentences and few words, but I'm afraid I won't be doing any role-play with you if you fall into that category. Sorry, it just bores me personally so I'd rather not partake in it. I really like posting to para length and anything above, I usually do multi para myself. All that being said I don't expect my partners to match my post length, if you're more comfortable with just three or so sentences then great, I'll probably still do a couple of paragraphs because it's my style, but you don't have to feel pressured to produce the same amount.</li>
<br><br>
And that about sums it all up. Feel free to approach me, I'm down to just chat, even game. No messages are a bother, really, can't wait to see you around!

<h1>Appearance</h1>
Joy is a young woman who spent a good majority of her early life worrying about her looks. She developed a passion for aesthetic and decided to keep her own appearance on level with personal beauty standards. While others might take the obsession too far this particular blond managed to keep a decent balance, not projecting her standards on others while also being stubborn enough to keep their opinions separate from her own. Now that she’s technically fully grown the level of pure commitment definitely shows. Joy’s skin is soft and smooth, retaining a natural shade of tan that looks as though it was earned on the beach but has much more to do with the blood running through her veins. She is slender but by no means lacking in feminine shape; a lithe figure is accentuated by thick hourglass curves. The perks of her larger chest and rounded rear are greatly appreciated. 
<br><br>
Soft shiny strands of golden hair grace her shoulders like a veil, framing an oval shaped face made complete by its lively features. Other than rounded cheeks, the Goddess’ Vessel also possesses a charming white toothed smile behind a pair of full rosy lips, one small ever so slightly upturned nose, and a pair of almond shaped eyes colored a beautiful amber shade. There’s even a light splash of barely visible freckles that speckle the skin of her nose and cheeks.
<br><br>
<h1>Personality</h1>
Compassionate, merciful, kind hearted, caring; these are all words that can be used to describe Joy at her core. It’s even applicable to the shell of a person she’s become as Erena’s Vessel … in most cases. Erena is believed to be a good deity who cares about her people, but she often behaves cruelly when her image is protected by the guise of justice. To criminals she is known to be fearsome, harsh, and unforgiving. She’s well aware of the conflict between extremes constantly brewing within her own mind, sometimes compromising situations thanks to her own onslaughts of horror and depression as a direct result. Joy isn’t sure what to think, is she a failure as a goddess or is she literally going crazy?

<h1>Her Story Thus Far ...</h1>
There isn’t much about the story of Joy Williams that merits interest or attention. Just a plain human girl, with ridiculously religious parents sure, but it didn’t seem to be doing her any harm. Their pretty blond daughter often set a decent example for her peers, at least on the surface. She got good grades--never straight A’s but nothing under B’s either--and had a clean school record, only getting sent to detention once during her entire twelve years over a petty argument. Joy attracted a lot of attention from girls and boys, not necessarily popular in the stereotypical sense, but she still possessed far more friends than she did enemies. 
<br><br>
Over the course of her teenage years the blossoming young woman managed to successfully balance a social life, appearing like a good devout member of the Erenian faith, and maintaining an exceptional grade point average. Sure, she attended some parties, talked back to her parents, got in trouble for staying out past curfew, but there were no real concerns or abnormal instances of behavior fueling her actions. By the time Joy was ready to graduate her life was going really well; she had a great boyfriend who cared for her, an acceptance letter from her first choice University, and even a job worked out to help pay for school. Unfortunately one little gathering was all it took to throw all those consecutive progressive years right down the drain.
<br><br>
On the day before the official Graduation ceremony all Seniors are required to attend a religious service, congratulating them for their achievements and welcoming them into the world as true adults. Every so often, when the current Vessel of Erena dies, a new one is chosen among the soon-to-be graduates. No one truly knows the intricacies of the election process, priests claim the Goddess Herself handpicks who the replacement will be by writing the desired candidate’s name down on a piece of paper. Much to Joy’s dismay it was her own that was read out to the crowd, scrawled in fancy lettering on a piece of holy parchment. From that moment on she no longer had any control over her own life. 
<br><br>
The young girl had only the next day to herself, one final chance to say goodbye to friends and family and celebrate her achievements as a human being before getting shipped off to become the new Erena. While other people congratulated them and drank to their good fortune, Joy’s loved ones gathered together in solemn mourning, knowing full well their daughter would leave and never return. It would be as if she didn’t even exist, her entire identity wiped away and replaced by the consciousness of their deity. To run from this fate was disgraceful an would end only in execution befitting someone who committed acts of treason. All she could do was obey the orders of the religious military upon their arrival and watch her childhood home grow ever distant from inside the tinted windows of an escorted van. Anything following those depressing moments even the awakened Erena cannot recall. Joy was no more.
<br><br>
Not long after the next Vessel was established in the Temple of Justice a new threat to her reign presented itself in the form of a man, a mage who specialized in dark magic and forbidden arts. He was very familiar to her, in ways even the Goddess could not understand, but these instances of dejavu were brushed aside by her priests. They declared the fiend to be her ancient nemesis, the Satan to her Jesus, and demanded all her resources be used to ensure his defeat. A great battle commenced between them, but Erena had not yet gained enough strength to defeat such a powerful foe. For the sake of morale, and the newest Vessel’s safety, Erena was encouraged to relocate and build an army elsewhere, in a land where magic was more common and mages could be recruited in greater number to serve as her weapons of war. Following their advice she fled to a plane of existence known as Gaeldra, eventually setting up shop in the Cloud Expanse of Yonder. Despite the beautiful city’s welcoming atmosphere, and the confidence that accompanied being on the “right” side of a struggle between forces of good and evil, human doubts still plague the Holy Mother’s mind. Who will answer her call to action and raise their weapons to combat the darkness? Who is willing to sacrifice themselves in the face of evil for the sake of the greater good? Patience is all she requires, but time is running out. Is hope lost, or is there a better way to successfully recruit the pure hearted to her cause?

Goddess' Equipment
</div>
<div id="tab15">
<h1>Weapons</h1>
Work in progress.
<br><br>
<h1>Tools</h1>
<b>Sacred Armor of the Holy Crusader</b><br>
A set of full body armor lacking only a helmet, possessing a simple fabric hood in its place. The metal alloy used to fabricate it is incredibly durable but purposefully applied in thin layers to remain fairly light and keep flexible room for ample body movement. It’s fancy aesthetically, technically intended more for ceremonial uses but is still functional in real combat. An array of sleek whites, golds, and silvers make up the armor’s colors. Despite its over the top name the magical augmentation attached to this equipment is very minor and only has to do with the hood. When pulled over its wearer’s head and willed into activation, the natural shadows it produces over the face are exaggerated to the extreme, allowing the wearer to hide their features behind a curtain of forced darkness.
<br><br>
<b>Crystal Ball</b><br>
While popular culture and media often depicts these oversized glass spheres to be tools for witches and gypsies, in the Court of Erena they are merely advanced telephones. Crystal Balls are a means of communication, allowing video and audio feed to be passed between them. It can only be used to contact--or “call”--other Crystal Balls.
<br><br>
<h1>Jewelry</h1>
<b>Wreath of Regality</b><br>
A golden crown fashioned to sit around the wearer’s head and designed to look like a leafy wreath. There isn’t anything special about it, the crown’s only value is in the precious metals used to craft it and the symbolism behind its existence.
<br><br>
<b>Heart Necklace</b><br>
The most simplistic object in her possession. Erena was not supposed to keep objects belonging to her human vessel, but she somehow managed to sneak this one past the priests and officers. It’s crafted entirely out of silver, chain and all, but the charm that dangles perfectly against her collarbone just makes the outline of a heart shape. She has no memory of Joy’s life, nor who even gave her such a gift, but she feels strangely attached to the object and just doesn’t have it in her to throw it away.
